<h1 align="center">Install Dart on Solus OS</h1>

### Hello!

The Dart SDK has the libraries and command-line tools that you need to develop Dart web, command-line, and server apps. If you’re developing only mobile apps, then you don’t need the Dart SDK; just install Flutter.

To learn about other tools you can use for Dart development, see the Dart tools page. To learn about what’s in the SDK, see Dart SDK overview.

This script speeds up the installation of the Dart SDK on the Solus OS, configuring and adding to the PATH, to be used.

## 1. Dependencies
